Hells Kitchen
Gordon Ramsay shouts. He shouts and swears. There may be something wrong with him.

Anyway, you will be given a string of four words. Your job is to turn them in to Gordon language.

Rules:

Obviously the words should be Caps, Every word should end with '!!!!', Any letter 'a' or 'A' should become '@', Any other vowel should become '*'.
*/

function gordon(a) {
  return `${a.toUpperCase().replace(/ /g, '!!!! ').replace(/A/g, '@').replace(/[EIOU]/g, '*')}!!!!`;
}
