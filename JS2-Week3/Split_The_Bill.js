It's tricky keeping track of who is owed what when spending money in a group. Write a function to balance the books.

The function should take one parameter: an object/dict with two or more name-value pairs which represent the members of the group and the amount spent by each.
The function should return an object/dict with the same names, showing how much money the members should pay or receive.
Further points:

The values should be positive numbers if the person should receive money from the group, negative numbers if they owe money to the group.
If value is a decimal, round to two decimal places.
Translations and comments (and upvotes!) welcome.

Example
3 friends go out together: A spends £20, B spends £15, and C spends £10. The function should return an object/dict showing that A should receive £5, B should receive £0, and C should pay £5.

var group = {
    A: 20,
    B: 15,
    C: 10
}

splitTheBill(group) // returns {A: 5, B: 0, C: -5}
*/

const splitTheBill = (x) => {
  const cost = (Object.values(x).reduce((a, b) => a + b) / Object.keys(x).length).toFixed(2);
  Object.keys(x).map((k) => x[k] = parseFloat((x[k] - cost).toFixed(2)));
  return x;
};
